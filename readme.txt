## About the project "MyForm"
I did this small project once as a test assignment for a job. The task was to develop a form that will send input data via mail and also stores it in a database.
I included this as a second project because my main project is not yet connected to a database and I want to cover this knowledge for the module.
To show that the database works I included a screenvideo.
